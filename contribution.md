The purpose of this project is to simplify to the process of analyzing content sets within [FactSet's Data Exploration Environment](https://open.factset.com/products/data-exploration/en-us), with the initial focus residing on the creation of a universe from based on an ETF ticker, the retrieval of security meta data, and historical pricing information.

our internal projects and teams. If a change would be detrimental to that goal, we ask that it be 
developed in a separate fork.
